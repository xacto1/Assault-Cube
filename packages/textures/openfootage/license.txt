Can i use the footage for commercial works?

Yes you can, all the footage is realeased under the creative commons copyrights giving you the rights to use for commercial, non commercial, remixes or whatever you want. The only exeception is you are not allowed to resell or redistribute the textures on other footage sites or collections.

So you give up all your copyrights?

The only thing I want from you is that you write my site www.openfootage.net in the credits of your work.
