Can I use these textures for free?
You can use any texture for personal or school projects without my permission. However if you decide to 
distribute your work I would appreciate credit where credit is due.

Where can I not use these textures?
Any webpage, program, or texture cd that has them available without my permission is not permitted. You can 
however use them in a design scheme for your site.

what's with the update delays?
Since I'm a full time student and freelance web designer, it's a little hard for me to find time to get out 
and take pictures (especially since i live in arizona and it's 500 degrees outside). Lately though I've been 
trying a lot harder to put a lot more work into the sites content.
