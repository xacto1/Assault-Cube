                    Dedicated servers run in the shell only (no graphics), with increased priority
                    yet use very little cpu time and memory, so you can run one in the background,
                    or at the same time with a client if you want to host a game. Server ports default to
                    UDP <b>28763</b> (game) and <b>28764</b> (info). If you choose to set your own port as X
                    it will automatically use X+1 for the info port!
                    See the <a href="getstarted.html" shape="rect">Get Started Guide</a> to find out
                    how to join a server.

                <p>
                    The AssaultCube server is mainly configured using command line options set in
                    the server script <i>assaultcube_server.bat</i> on windows or
                    <i>assaultcube_server.sh</i> on linux.

                <p>
                    Possible command line options can be obtained from the <a href=

                    Run the script to start the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Command line options can also be written to a file (one option per line). Use the <tt>-C</tt>

                    empower you to change which lines will be played when your server is rather empty or closer to full.

                    In the blacklist file specified on the command line (default:
                    <i>config/serverblacklist.cfg</i>), you can specify IP addresses and IP address ranges to be denied
                    access to your server. Each line defines one IP address (range).

                <p>
                    You can use three different schemes to specify IP address ranges:

                    to get over server bans. Each line defines one password.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    In the above example three passwords are defined: <i>Lorem</i>, <i>ipsum</i> and <i>dolor</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>ipsum</i> and <i>dolor</i> are full admin passwords. They can be used to claim admin, connect
                    to a full server and to get over a server ban.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Lorem</i> is a less powerful password: it can only be used to connect to a server that has a pending
                    ban on the user. This kind of password is useful, whenever a blacklist range ban affects innocent players.

                    Nickname Blacklist

                <p>
                    In the nickname blacklist file specified on the command line (default:
                    <i>config/nicknameblacklist.cfg</i>), you can configure the nickname blacklist and the nickname
                    whitelist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever a player connects to a server (or changes his nickname), the nickname is compared to the
                    whitelist and the blacklist. First, the nickname (as a whole) is searched in the whitelist. If the
                    nickname is in the whitelist, the player's IP and password are checked (if required). If an IP range
                    or password requirement is not met, the player gets kicked. If the nickname is not in the whitelist,
                    it is checked, if any blacklist entries match. If a blacklist entry matches, the player gets kicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To prevent whitelist entries to be misused by other players, each entry can be secured by one or more
                    IP ranges and one or more passwords. IP ranges are very convenient to use. For players with static IP,
                    this is a very secure method to prevent others from using the nickname. If the IP is dynamic, it
                    depends on how big the used IP range is. A single /16 range should be secure enough for most cases.
                    If the range is bigger, the IP range will not block others sufficiently. In those cases, passwords can
                    be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following commands can be used in nicknameblacklist.cfg:

                    <dt>

                        Add <dfn>nickname</dfn> to the whitelist. IP ranges and passwords are optional; if IP ranges are
                        specified, only connects from that ranges are allowed; if one or more passwords are specified,
                        the connect password has to match one of them.

                <p>
                    Cheating is a problem that can't be solved entirely. AssaultCube is opensource,
                    so everyone that knows how to compile it can easily modify the source to do
                    whatever he wants, thats the problem of opensource games. The fact that the
                    whole game logic is client-side, to save a lot bandwith, makes it even easier
                    to cheat. There is no way to avoid this abuse.

                    There is a client role a player can claim called <i>admin</i>. It can be
                    claimed by the real owner of a server to take control over what is happening
                    when they are present. Claiming admin state requires a password that matches
                    the server configuration.

                        gives the master state to a player
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Use the <span class="code">setadmin</span> command to claim admin if you are
                    already connected to a sever. However if you are locked out of your own server
                    because you are banned, master mode is private or because all client slots are
                    taken, you can use the <span class="code">connectadmin</span> command to get
                    control back though. If you want to leave the server in the hands of a certain
                    player <span class="code">giveadmin</span> can be used to give control to a
                    honest player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The admin password is configured using the <a href="commandline.html" shape=
                    "rect">-x command-line option</a>.
