                You can also assign custom keys to specific weapons by using the keybinding menu

            <p>
                This is simple. Just press ESC and then navigate to <b>Singleplayer</b>, then choose
                the mode, bot skill, amount of enemies and the map. Then, a game with computer-bot
                enemies will start immediately.

                Joining a multiplayer game
            </h2>
            <p>
                In game, press ESC and choose <i>Multiplayer ⇒ Join a server</i>. The masterserver
                will be queried and provide you with a list of servers. The list of servers are saved in <i>config/servers.cfg</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the <a href="interface.html#hud" shape="rect">console</a> says "master server
                not replying", then that means your client failed to download the list of servers
                to play upon, and you will need to <i>Force serverlist update</i> until it updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly by using the <i>Custom connect</i> menu and
                then enter a valid IP or DNS name of a server, the port and optionally, a password, if the server
                uses one.

            <h2>
                Changing settings
            </h2>
            <p>
                Most important setting changes can actually be changed from within the menus. So,
                press <b>ESC</b> and then <b>Settings</b>. There are many important settings in
                this menu that can be changed, including changing your name and team. Look in there
                for what you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are of course other settings which can't be found inside the menu. These settings
                can be changed via the console. Check out the <a href="reference.xml" shape="rect">
                    reference</a> to find out about those settings and how they can be changed.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How settings are saved
            </h2>
            <p>
                There is a file called <i>defaults.cfg</i> in the <i>config</i> directory. When
                you run AssaultCube for the first time it will execute this file. Once you quit
                AssaultCube, the default settings and your changes created upon them during the
                course of the game (and settings from your autoexec.cfg) will be stored in <i>config/saved.cfg</i>.
                If you want to reset your settings to default values just delete <i>config/saved.cfg</i>.
                Alternatively, you can delete it using the menus, by pressing ESCAPE and going into:
                Settings ⇒ Reset all settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there are commands that you would like executed every time AssaultCube starts,
                you can insert these scripting commands into <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When AssaultCube is started, it will check for the file <i>config/init.cfg</i>.
                If it does not exist then AssaultCube assumes this is the first time you have ran
                AssaultCube and will prompt you with the "quick setup" menu. This contains settings
                for you to change that are important for running AssaultCube. Such as screen resolution,
                mouse sensitivity, nickname, etc. When you press "OK", then AssaultCube will restart
                to allow those settings to take effect. The <i>config/init.cfg</i> file saves settings
                that can only be changed before AssaultCube runs, so when AssaultCube first starts,
                it will execute those settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note for linux users: Config files get saved in the hidden directory <i>.assaultcube/config</i>
                in your users home directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note for windows users: Config files get saved in a directory in your "My Documents" folder.

                Demos are a little bit like video recordings of the game, except what they really
		do is record all the moves made in the game so it can be replayed later (it is not
		a video file!). Demo's are recorded on THE SERVER only (as recording demos locally
		causes issues).
            </p>
            <p>
		Demo's can only be recorded if you are an <b>ADMIN</b> and have the servers admin password. 
		To record a demo, take admin and use the demo menu (Press <b>ESC</b> in-game and go to <b>Demos</b>).
		The next match, a recording will be made and you can vote to stop recording the
                demo at any time through: <i>Demos ⇒ Stop recording</i>. When the demo
                stops being recorded you will be prompted to download it by pressing <b>F10</b>
                and if pressed your demo will be downloaded.
            </p>

                you can use: <i>Demos ⇒ Download demos</i> in the menus.
